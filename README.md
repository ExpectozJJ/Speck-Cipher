# Speck Cipher

Speck is a family of lightweight block ciphers publicly released by the National Security Agency (NSA) in June 2013. 
Speck has been optimized for performance in software implementations, while its sister algorithm, Simon, has been optimized 
for hardware implementations. Speck is an add-rotate-xor (ARX) cipher. As Speck is a lightweight block cipher, many ciphers of this family 
are being progressively implemented into Internet of Things (IoT).
